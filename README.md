# Image Slider Courasel

## Description
Welcome aboard developer, this is where you are going to find a simple way to build an Image Slider Courasel using React.
A courasel is a UI element that displays information in a set of elements that we can slide, fade or somehow move into view. A courasel can sideshow images, text, video or a combination of all of them. In this courasel, I build an image slider to slide images into view automatically or once a function is triggered on clicking the arrows.

## Learning Objective
This simple project will help you understand and work with:
- React Top Level APIs used in this project
    Eg: - React.cloneElement()
        - React.Children.count(children)
        - React.Children.map()
- How react props work in passing data from parent to children and vise versa
- Using React Hooks such as useState() and useEffect()
